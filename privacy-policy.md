# Privacy Policy for Automation Livestream Segments App

Effective Date: August 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Automation Livestream Segments app (the "App") handles data. The App is a personal automation script I use to manage my own YouTube channel via the YouTube Data API.

## Data Collection and Use
- The App does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. It only accesses my own YouTube account to create/manage livestream broadcasts, update video metadata (e.g., titles), and post chat messages.
- OAuth scopes used: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube (manage broadcasts and videos), https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl (secure API access), https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload (reserved for future uploads).
- All data handling complies with Google's API Services User Data Policy and YouTube API Developer Policies.

## No Third-Party Sharing
- No data is shared with third parties. The App runs locally on my machine.

## Changes to This Policy
- I may update this policy as needed. Contact: detroitriverside@gmail.com.

This App is for personal use and does not target children.
